  <title>Systems of linear equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
     Computing and studying solutions to equations, and <em>systems of equations</em>, unquestionably plays an important role in mathematics; though we hasten to add that this is not all that mathematicians do! In this chapter we will develop an essentially complete theory of a particularly simple family of mathematical equations: namely, <em>linear equations</em>.  This will serve as a somewhat indirect introduction to our study of linear algebra, as lurking below our parametric descriptions of solutions to linear systems lie vector space notions like subspace, span, and linear independence. Furthermore, we will meet one of the most important computational tools of linear algebra: <xref ref="d_GE" text="custom">Gaussian elimination</xref>.

      <p>A <term>linear equation</term> in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n</m> is an equation that can be simplified, using only addition and subtraction, to an equation of the form

        Given a linear equation with standard form <xref ref="eq_std_form"/>, the equation is called <term>homogeneous</term> if <m>b=0</m>, and <term>nonhomogeneous</term> if <m>b\ne 0</m>.

        A <term>system of linear equations</term>

  When displaying a system of <m>m</m> equations in the <m>n</m> unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\dots x_n</m>, we typically write each equation in standard form and align the corresponding terms of each equation into columns:
    <me>
      \eqsys
    </me>
A homogeneous system is thus typically written as:
<me>
  \homsys.

      You will want to get comfortable with the double-indexing used to display linear systems as quickly as possible. Here is a good way to orient yourself:

        The <m>i</m> appearing in <m>a_{ij}</m> and <m>b_i</m> indicates the <m>i</m>-th row in our displayed system, or equivalently, the <m>i</m>-th equation.

    Given a linear system we will seek to find the set of
    <em>all</em> solutions to the system.
    As we will soon see, this set of solutions will take one of three qualitative forms:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The solution set is empty; i.e., there are no solutions.
          We say the system is <term>inconsistent</term> in this case.
          Otherwise a system is called <term>consistent</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The solution set contains a single element;
          i.e., there is exactly one solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The solution set contains infinitely many elements;
          i.e., there are infinitely solutions.

   <solution>
    <p>
     <ol>
      <li><p>The first equation implies <m>x=y</m>.
    Substituting <m>y</m> for <m>x</m> in the second equation, we would then have <m>0=1</m>, a contradiction.
    Thus there are no solutions: i.e., <m>S</m> is the empty set, denoted <m>S=\{ \ \}</m> or <m>S=\emptyset</m>.
    </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first equation implies <m>x=y</m>.
          Making this substitution in the second equation yields <m>2x=1</m>, or <m>x=1/2</m>.
          Thus <m>(x,y)=(1/2,1/2)</m> is the unique solution,
          and <m>S=\{ (1/2,1/2)\}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The second equation is just twice the first. It follows that both equations have the exact same set of solutions, and
          so we need only find all solutions to <m>x-y=1</m>.
          Note that we can set <m>x=t</m> for <em>any</em>
          real number <m>t \in\R</m>.
          Solving for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>t</m> we get
          <m>(x,y)=(t,t-1)</m> for any <m>t\in\R</m>,
          and thus <m>S=\{(t,t-1)\colon t\in\R\}</m>, an infinite set!

  As you may recall, a (nontrivial) linear equation in two unknowns defines a line in <m>\R^2</m>; and a (nontrivial) equation in three unknowns defines a plane in <m>\R^3</m>. This observation allows us to bring powerful geometric intuition to analyzing systems of linear equations in two or three unknowns. As lines and planes will also serve as a rich source of examples in this course, we recall below some of their basic notions.

<example xml:id="eg_lines_planes_review">
  <title>Lines and planes review</title>
  <p>
        Below we define lines (in <m>\R^2</m>) and planes (in <m>\R^3</m>) as sets of solutions of linear equations in two or three unknowns. Recall that the <term>graph</term> of an equation is the set of all solutions to the equation.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>Lines</title>
            <p>
              A <term>line</term> in <m>\R^2</m> is the set of solutions (or graph) <m>\ell</m> of a linear equation of the form <m>ax+by=c</m>, where <m>a, b, c\in\R</m> are fixed constants, and at least one of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is nonzero: <ie />,
              <me>
                \ell=\{(x,y)\in\R^2\colon ax+by=c\}.

            <p>
              A <term>plane</term> in <m>\R^3</m> is the set of solutions (or graph) <m>\mathcal{P}</m> of a linear equation of the form <m>ax+by+cz=d</m>, where <m>a, b, c, d\in\R</m> are fixed constants, and at least one of <m>a, b, c</m> is nonzero: <ie />,
              <me>
                \mathcal{P}=\{(x,y,z)\in\R^3\colon ax+by+cz=d\}.

            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      We often use the abbreviated notation
      <md>
        <mrow>\ell \amp\colon ax+by=c \amp \mathcal{P}\amp\colon ax+by+cz=d</mrow>
      </md>
      to introduce the line <m>\ell</m> with defining equation <m>ax+by=c</m> or plane <m>\mathcal{P}</m> with defining equation <m>ax+by+cz=d</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a plane <m>\mathcal{P}\colon ax+by+cz=d</m>, we call <m>\boldn=(a,b,c)</m> a <term>normal vector</term> of <m>\mathcal{P}</m>. Equipped with the normal vector <m>\boldn</m> and a single point <m>P=(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> lying on <m>\mathcal{P}</m>, we can quickly visualize <m>\mathcal{P}</m> as the set of all points <m>Q=(x,y,z)</m> such that the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}=(x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0)</m> is orthogonal to <m>\mathcal{n}</m>. This allows us to envision <m>\mathcal{P}</m> as <q>the plane passing through <m>P</m> and orthogonal to <m>\boldn</m></q>.

  For each system in <xref ref="s_systems_eg_2eqns2varss"/>, use a geometric argument to determine <em>how many</em> solutions there are. 
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    We proceed geometrically by observing that each equation in a given system defines a line, that a pair <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution to the given equation if and only if it is a point on the corresponding line, and thus that a pair <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution to both equations if and only if it is a point lying on both lines. Thus, geometrically speaking, the set of solutions to a given system is equal to the intersection of the two corresponding lines. 
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          In this case the two lines <m>\ell_1\colon x-y=0</m> and <m>\ell_2\colon x-y=1</m> are parallel (and not equal to one another). It follows that their intersection is empty. We conclude that there are no solutions to the system. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In this case the two lines <m>\ell_1\colon x-y=0</m> and <m>\ell_2\colon x+y=1</m> are nonparallel. It follows that they intersect in a single point. We conclude that the system has a unique solution.

        <p>
          In this case the two equations <m>x-y=1</m> and <m>2x-2y=2</m> define the same line <m>\ell</m>, and thus that their intersection is also equal to <m>\ell</m>. The set of solutions to the system is then equal to the set of points of <m>\ell</m>, which is infinite.

   <title>Row operations</title>

  In <xref ref="s_systems_eg_2eqns2varss"/> we were able to combine some simple logic and arithmetic to solve each system completely.  Of course, things get more complicated as the number of equations and/or unknowns in the system increases.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider the system
    <men xml:id="s_systems_eq_runningexample">
      \begin{linsys}{3} 2x\amp -\amp y\amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 3\\ x\amp \amp \amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 2 \\ x\amp -\amp y\amp \amp \amp =\amp 1 \end{linsys}
    </men>
  Observe first that the triple <m>(5,2,5)</m> is not a solution to the system; one easily checks that is satisfies the first and second equations, but not the third. Similarly, it is easy to verify that <m>(4,2,3)</m> and <m>(0,-1,2)</m> are both solutions to the system. The question remains: How do we find <em>all</em> solutions to the linear system in a systematic way?
</p>
<remark>
  <p>Notice the somewhat funny spacing in <xref ref="s_systems_eq_runningexample"/>. This is in force in order to align the unknowns in separate columns. In general, when handed a linear system in the wild, your first step should be to write each equation in standard form, and make sure the unknowns are aligned vertically in this manner.

  The staircase pattern of <m>L'</m> allows us to solve easily by
    <em>backwards substitution</em>. In more detail:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Equation 3 in <m>L'</m> tells us that <m>z=2</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Now substitute <m>z=2</m> into Equation 2 of <m>L'</m> and solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y=4</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Finally, substitute <m>y=4</m> and <m>z=2</m> into Equation 1 of <m>L'</m>and solve for <m>x</m> to get <m>x=4</m>.
      We conclude that <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m> is a solution to <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Furthermore, since at each step we had no choice in the matter (<m>z</m> must be equal to 2, <m>y</m> then must be equal to 4, etc.), we see that in fact <m>(4,4,2)</m> is the <em>only</em> solution to <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Our method for solving a more complicated system,
    like <m>L</m> above, will be to <em>transform</em>
    it to a simpler system like <m>L'</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Key point</em>. In order for this method to work,
    we need to make sure that the transformed system has <em>exactly</em>
    the same solutions as the original system!
    To this end we will restrict our permissible transformations to the <em>elementary  operations</em> define below.

      The act of transforming a system of equations using elementary operations is called <term>reduction</term> (or <term>row reduction</term>).

    <p>
      After reducing a linear system <m>L</m> using elementary operations, we are left with a new system <m>L'</m>. The systems <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> will generally look very different from one another. Note, however, that the two systems will have the same <em>number</em> of equations, and the same <em>number</em> of variables. More importantly, the two systems will have identical sets of solutions; that is, the set of solutions of the new system <m>L'</m> is identical to the set of solutions to <m>L</m>!
    </p>
    <p> To convince ourselves of this last assertion, it suffices to show that the application of any one of these elementary row operations produces a new system <m>L'</m> with exactly the same set of solutions as <m>L</m>; if this is so, then performing any finite sequence of elementary row operations must also preserve the set of solutions in this sense. <xref ref="s_systems_th_rowops"/> makes this argument official. First we introduce the notion of <em>equivalent linear systems</em>, mainly to spare ourselves from the mouthful that is <q>obtained by applying a finite sequence of elementary row operations</q>.

    <title>Row equivalent linear systems</title>

      <p>
        We say two systems of linear equations are
        <term>row equivalent</term> 
        if the one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of elementary operations.

    <title>Row equivalence theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Row equivalent systems of linear equations have identical sets of solutions.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove by induction that if system <m>L'</m> is the result of applying <m>n</m> elementary operations to system <m>L</m>, <m>n\geq 0</m>, then <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have the same set of solutions.
      </p>
      <case>
        <title> Base case: <m>n=0</m></title>
        <p>
          In this case <m>L=L'</m> (we have applied no operations) and the statement is obvious.
        </p>
      </case>
      <case>
        <title>Induction step</title>
        <p>Assume that applying a sequence of <m>n</m> elementary operations to a linear system preserves the set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>L'</m> is the result of applying <m>n+1</m> elementary operations to the system <m>L</m>. Let <m>L''</m> be the result of applying the first <m>n</m> of these operations. By the induction hypothesis, systems <m>L</m> and <m>L''</m> have the same set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the system <m>L'</m> is obtained from <m>L''</m> by applying exactly one elementary operation, it now suffices to show that applying a single row operation does not change the set of solutions to a linear system. This is the result of <xref ref="ex_row_ops_preserve"/>. (Note that a solution is provided to that exercise.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have the same set of solutions, as desired.

      Now put the logic together. Our original linear system <m>L</m> was transformed by a sequence of elementary row operations to a new system <m>L'</m>:

    <p>
      We saw already that the second system has exactly one solution,
      namely the triple <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since transforming a system by row operations preserves solutions,
      the first and second systems have
      <em>exactly the same solutions</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m> is the only solution to the original system!

  As we will see later, keeping track of the exact sequence of row operations is important in some situations. The notation used in the last example is useful for this bookkeeping. Let's explicate the notation somewhat.
 </p>
 <p>
   The notation
   <me>
     L\xrightarrow{c\, e_i}L'
   </me>
   indicates that system <m>L'</m> is obtained from <m>L</m> by replacing equation <m>e_i</m> with <m>c\, e_i</m>.

 </p>
 <p>
   The notation
   <me>
     L\xrightarrow{e_i\leftrightarrow e_j}L'
   </me>
   indicates that system <m>L'</m> is obtained from <m>L</m> by swapping rows <m>e_i</m> and <m>e_j</m>.
 </p>
 <p>
   The notation
   <me>
     L\xrightarrow{e_i+c\,e_j}L'
   </me>
   indicates that system <m>L'</m> is obtained from <m>L</m> by replacing equation <m>e_i</m> with <m>e_i+c\,e_i</m>.

<p>
  You may be tempted to do multiple operations in a single step during this procedure. Resist this temptation for now until we have a better understanding of things.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, if later on you do give in to this temptation, make sure that the two (or more row operations) you perform are independent of one another. For example, do not swap <m>e_2</m> with <m>e_1</m> and replace <m>e_3</m> with <m>e_3-5e_2</m> in the same step.
