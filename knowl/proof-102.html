<div class="para">(Recall that for any matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> the notation <span class="process-math">\(B_{ij}\)</span> denotes the submatrix obtained by removing the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th row and <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th column of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>) First observe that <span class="process-math">\((t-A)_{11}=t-A_{11}\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(\det(t-A)_{11}\)</span> is the characteristic polynomial of the <span class="process-math">\((n-1)\times (n-1)\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A_{11}\text{.}\)</span> By induction this is a monic polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(n-1\text{,}\)</span> and hence the first term of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_char_poly_proof.html" title="Equation 5.4.11">(5.4.11)</a>, <span class="process-math">\((t-a_{11})\det(t-A)_{11}\)</span> is a monic polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Unfortunately, the remaining terms in the expansion <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_char_poly_proof.html" title="Equation 5.4.11">(5.4.11)</a> do not lend themselves to a direct application of the induction hypothesis. However, we observe that the <span class="process-math">\((n-1)\times (n-1)\)</span> submatrices <span class="process-math">\((t-A)_{1j}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(j\geq 2\)</span> all satisfy the following property: their first columns contains only scalars; the remaining columns contain exactly one entry of the form <span class="process-math">\(t-c\text{,}\)</span> while the rest of the entries are scalars. An easy (additional) induction argument shows that the determinant of such a matrix is polynomial of degree at most <span class="process-math">\(n-2\text{.}\)</span> (We leave this to you!) Since the first term of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_char_poly_proof.html" title="Equation 5.4.11">(5.4.11)</a> is a monic polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and the rest of the terms are polynomials of degree at most <span class="process-math">\(n-2\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(p(t)\)</span> itself is a monic polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> as desired.</div>
