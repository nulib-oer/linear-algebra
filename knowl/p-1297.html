<div class="para">To summarize, starting with row equivalent matrices  <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> in reduced row echelon form, and assuming by contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(U\ne U'\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that (a) the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are equal and form matrices in reduced row echelon form, and (b) the last columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> have leading ones. Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are in reduced row echelon form, and since the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are equal, we see that the leading ones in the last columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> must occur in the same row: namely, the first zero row of <span class="process-math">\(V=V'\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(U=U'\text{,}\)</span> a contradiction.</div>
