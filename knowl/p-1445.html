<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(S=\{\boldv_1, \boldv_2, \dots , \boldv_r\}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Assume <span class="process-math">\(\Span S=V\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> be a subset of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <em class="emphasis">minimal cardinality</em> such that <span class="process-math">\(\Span S'\)</span> is still equal to <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Such a set is guaranteed to exist: since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is finite, it has a finite number of subsets; of these subsets some will span, others will not; of the subsets that do span, there will be one (or more) that has the least number of elements.</p>
<p>We claim that such a spanning subset <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> of minimal cardinality is linearly independent, and hence is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> as desired. We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> is linearly dependent. Then some element of <span class="process-math">\(S'\text{,}\)</span> call it <span class="process-math">\(\boldv_0\text{,}\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of the other elements (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rm_linear_independence.html" title="Remark 4.4.9">Remark 4.4.9</a>). Then in terms of span, the element <span class="process-math">\(\boldv_0\)</span> is “redundant”. In other words, if we let <span class="process-math">\(S''=S'-\{\boldv_0\}\text{,}\)</span> the set obtained by “throwing out” <span class="process-math">\(\boldv_0\text{,}\)</span> then we have <span class="process-math">\(\Span S''=\Span S'=V\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\val{S''} &lt; \val{S}\text{,}\)</span> this contradicts our choice of <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> as a spanning set of minimal cardinality. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> is linearly independent, completing the proof.</p>

<p>Assume <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly independent. The procedure below constructs a finite chain of sets</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
S=S_0\subseteq S_1\dots \subseteq S_k
\end{equation*}

<p class="continuation">that ends with a basis <span class="process-math">\(B=S_k\text{.}\)</span></p>

<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Expansion loop.</span></span><p>If <span class="process-math">\(\Span S_i=V\text{,}\)</span> return <span class="process-math">\(B=S_i\text{.}\)</span> Otherwise set <span class="process-math">\(S_{i+1}=S_i\cup \{\boldv\}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\)</span> is any element of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> that is not contained in <span class="process-math">\(\Span S_i\)</span> and repeat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Some observations:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Each <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> is linearly independent. This can be shown by induction, the crucial point being that if <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> is linearly independent, and if <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\notin \Span S_i\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(S_{i+1}=S_i\cup \{\boldv_0\}\)</span> is linearly independent. The proof is left as an exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>The procedure must halt. Why? Since <span class="process-math">\(\dim V=n\text{,}\)</span> and since each <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> is linearly independent, we must have <span class="process-math">\(\val{S_i}\leq n\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_basis_dimension.html" title="Theorem 4.5.11: Basis bounds">Theorem 4.5.11</a>. Since <span class="process-math">\(\val{S_i}&lt; \val{S_{i+1}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\val{S_{i}}\leq n\text{,}\)</span> the procedure must halt in at most <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> steps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">From (ii) we may assume the procedure halts at <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\geq 0\text{.}\)</span> From (i) we know that <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> is linearly independent. Furthermore, since the procedure halts at <span class="process-math">\(S_k\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(\Span S_k=V\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(B=S_k\)</span> is a basis containing <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> as desired.</p>
