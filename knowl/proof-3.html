<div class="para">First recall that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> have the same set of solutions (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/s_systems_th_rowops.html" title="Theorem 1.1.13: Row equivalence theorem">TheoremÂ 1.1.13</a>). So it suffices to show that the algorithm returns the correct set of solutions to <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Regarding consistency: if the last column of the augmented matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> associated to <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> has a leading one in the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th row, then the corresponding equation in <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
0x_1+0x_2+\cdots 0x_n=1.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Clearly this equation has no solutions, and hence the set of solutions to <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> is empty.</div>

<div class="para">Suppose in Step 3 you determine that there are no free variables. Then each of the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> has a leading one in it.

<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> does not have a leading one in the last column, it follows that all equations beyond the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th equation are of the form <span class="process-math">\(0x_1+0x_2+\cdots 0x_n=0\text{,}\)</span> and as such may be disregarded since they are satisfied by any choice of the <span class="process-math">\(x_i\text{.}\)</span> The remaining system of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> equations in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> unknowns can be solved by back-substitution, yielding a <em class="emphasis">unique</em> solution <span class="process-math">\((x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)\)</span> of the form</div>

<div class="para">Do not concern yourself overly with the exact formulas. The important point here is that once we know there is a unique assignment of the variables <span class="process-math">\(x_n, x_{n-1},\dots, x_{i+1}\)</span> that satisfies the system, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/s_solving_case1eq.html" title="Equation 1.3.4">(1.3.4)</a> allows us to solve for <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> in terms of the the <span class="process-math">\(x_j\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(j&gt;i\text{.}\)</span> As such working our way up from the last equation, we find there is a unique solution to the system.</div>

<div class="para">The idea behind uniqueness here, is that once you assign values to the free variables, the values of the leading variables are completely determined by the equations <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_k}=F_k(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\text{.}\)</span>
