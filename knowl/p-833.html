<div class="para">We now lay out the various algebraic operations we will use to combine and transform matrices; we refer to the use of these operations loosely as <em class="emphasis">matrix arithmetic</em>. Some of these operations resemble familiar operations from real arithmetic in terms of their notation and definition. Do not be lulled into complacency! These are new operations defined for a new class of mathematical objects, and must be treated carefully. In particular, pay close attention to (a) exactly what type of mathematical objects serve as inputs for each operation (the <em class="emphasis">ingredients</em> of the operation), and (b) what type of mathematical object is outputted.</div>
