<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be an <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrix. Using Gauss-Jordan elimination, we can row reduce <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> in reduced row echelon form. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is also row equivalent to the matrix <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> in reduced row echelon form. Then <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are row equivalent, since the row equivalence relation is symmetric and transitive (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rm_row_equivalence_props.html" title="Remark 2.4.16: Properties of row equivalence">Remark 2.4.16</a>). Thus it suffices to show that if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are row equivalent matrices in reduced row echelon form, then <span class="process-math">\(U=U'\text{.}\)</span> We do so by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The base step is trivial, since there is only one <span class="process-math">\(m\times 1\)</span> matrix in reduced row echelon form.</div> <div class="para">For the induction step we assume that any two row equivalent <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrices in reduced row echelon form are equal.  Suppose by contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(U=[u_{ij}]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'=[u'_{ij}]\)</span> are row equivalent <span class="process-math">\(m\times (n+1)\)</span> matrices in reduced row echelon form, and that <span class="process-math">\(U\ne U'\text{.}\)</span>  By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_row_equivalence_invertibility.html" title="Corollary 2.4.15: Row equivalence and invertible matrices">Corollary 2.4.15</a> there is an invertible matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(QU=U'\text{.}\)</span> The first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> form matrices <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V'\text{,}\)</span> respectively, that are in reduced row echelon form, as one easily checks. Furthermore, <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V'\)</span> are row equivalent: indeed, using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_column_method.html" title="Theorem 2.1.24: Column method of matrix multiplication">Theorem 2.1.24</a> we see that <span class="process-math">\(QU=U'\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(QV=V'\text{.}\)</span> By the induction hypothesis we must have <span class="process-math">\(V=V'\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> can only differ in their last column.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We claim that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> must both have a leading one in the last column. To see why, consider the matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(U\boldx=\boldzero\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\boldx=[x_j]\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\((n+1)\times 1 \)</span> column vector.

</div> <div class="para">To summarize, starting with row equivalent matrices  <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> in reduced row echelon form, and assuming by contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(U\ne U'\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that (a) the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are equal and form matrices in reduced row echelon form, and (b) the last columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> have leading ones.
