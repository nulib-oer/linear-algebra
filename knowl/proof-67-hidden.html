<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(\CS A\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(\bolde_j\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(1\leq j\leq n\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\CS A=\R^n\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> Since the first <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are linearly independent (they are the elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span>), when we row reduce <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to a matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> in row echelon form, the first <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> will contain leading ones. (To see this, imagine row reducing the <span class="process-math">\(n\times r\)</span> submatrix <span class="process-math">\(A'\)</span> consisting of the first <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to a row echelon matrix <span class="process-math">\(U'\text{.}\)</span> Since these columns are linearly independent, they already form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\CS A'\text{.}\)</span> Thus the corresponding colmns of <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> must all have leading ones. ) It follows that the first <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are selected to be in the basis <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(S\subseteq B\text{,}\)</span> as desired.</p></article></article></body>
