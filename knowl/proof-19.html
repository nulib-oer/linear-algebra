<div class="para">First we show that if <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is one of the <span class="process-math">\(m\times m\)</span> elementary matrices, then it must assume one of the forms described above. Indeed, since multiplying on the left by <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> performs a certain row operation, and since <span class="process-math">\(E=E\,I_m\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> itself is the result of performing this particular row operation on the <span class="process-math">\(m\times m\)</span> identity matrix. Thus <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span>  is one of the three types of matrices described above, obtained by performing an elementary row operation on <span class="process-math">\(I_m\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Next, we must show that any of the <span class="process-math">\(m\times m\)</span> matrices <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> described above is indeed elementary in the sense of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_elementary_matrix.html" title="Definition 2.4.1: Elementary matrices">Definition 2.4.1</a>: that is, we must show that multiplying any <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> on the left by <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> performs the relevant row operation on <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> This is now a direct consequence of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_row_method.html" title="Theorem 2.1.26: Row method of matrix multiplication">Theorem 2.1.26</a>.</div> <div class="para">For example, take <span class="process-math">\(E=\underset{c\,r_i}{E}\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(j\ne i\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(E\,A\)</span> is given by the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Since the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> in this case has a one in the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th entry and zeros elsewhere, the product of this row and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is just the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(E\, A\)</span> in this case is <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> times the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> leaves all the rows of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> except for the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th one, which is scaled by <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>
