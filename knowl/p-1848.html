<div class="para">Thanks to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_basis_dimension.html" title="Theorem 3.7.3: Basis bounds">Theorem 3.7.3</a> we know that spanning sets can be contracted to bases, and linearly independent sets can be extended to bases; and we have already seen a few instances where this result has been put to good use. However, neither the theorem nor its proof provide a practical means of performing this contraction or extension. We would like a systematic way of determining which vectors to throw out (when contracting), or which vectors to chuck in (when extending). In the special case where <span class="process-math">\(V=\R^n\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we can adapt <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/proc_fund_spaces.html" title="Procedure 3.8.10: Computing bases of fundamental spaces">Procedure 3.8.10</a> to our needs.</div>
