<div class="para">Intuitively, we think of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> as a two-dimensional space, and <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> as three-dimensional one. Why? Loosely speaking this notion of dimension has something to do with the number of degrees of freedom involved in specifying a particular element of the given space: to specify an element of <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\in \R^2\)</span> we need to give its two coordinates; to specify an element of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> we need to give its three coordinates. Clearly, this conception is too imprecise to serve as a mathematical definition. What exactly does “degrees of freedom” mean? And how do you quantify the number of “degrees of freedom” needed for a given space? For example, we also think of a plane <span class="process-math">\(W\subseteq \R^3\)</span> passing through the origin as a two-dimensional object; it is not immediately clear how to square this intuition with our vague “degrees of freedom” formulation. In this section we introduce the definition of the <em class="emphasis">dimension</em> of a vector space, which will be a rigorous articulation of these notions. Our definition, which relies on the concept of bases, seems simple enough: the dimension of a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is defined as the number of elements contained in any basis <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> However, as we will see there is  considerable work involved (a) in proving that this definition is well-defined, and (b) in showing that it captures the intuition of dimension described above.</div>
