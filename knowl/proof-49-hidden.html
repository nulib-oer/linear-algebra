<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The proof amounts to the following observations:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">The zero function <span class="process-math">\(0_X\colon X\rightarrow \R\)</span> is an element of all of these sets: i.e. the zero function is continuous, <span class="process-math">\(C^n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C^\infty\text{,}\)</span> a polynomial, etc..</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> both satisfy one of these properties (continuous, <span class="process-math">\(C^n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C^\infty\text{,}\)</span> polynomial, etc.), then so does <span class="process-math">\(cf+dg\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(c,d\in \R\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">The second, “closed under linear combinations” observation is easily seen for <span class="process-math">\(P(X)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_n(X)\)</span> (i.e., the sum of two polynomials of degree at most <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is clearly a polynomial of degree at most <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>); for the other spaces, this is a result of calculus properties to the effect that adding and scaling functions preserves continuity and differentiability.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Lastly, that each subset relation holds in the given chain follows from similar observations: polynomials are infinitely differentiable, differentiable functions are continuous, etc..</div></article></body>
