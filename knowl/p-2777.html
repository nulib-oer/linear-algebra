<div class="para">Among the many takeaways from <a href="s_diagonalization.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.5: Diagonalization">Section 5.5</a> is the simple fact that not all matrices are diagonalizable. In principle <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_diagonalizability_eigenspaces.html" title="Theorem 5.5.13: Diagonalizability: dimension of eigenspaces">Theorem 5.5.13</a> gives a complete answer to the question of diagonalizability in terms of eigenspaces. However, you should not be mislead by the artificially simple examples treated in  <a href="s_diagonalization.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.5: Diagonalization">Section 5.5</a>. In practice even the determination (or approximation) of the distinct eigenvalues of an <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix poses a very challenging computational problem as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> gets large. As such the general question of whether a matrix is diagonalizable remains an intractable one. This makes all the more welcoming the main result of this section: <em class="emphasis">all</em> symmetric matrices are diagonalizable! This surprising fact is a consequence of the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_spectral.html" title="Theorem 5.6.8: Spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators">spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators</a>: a result which itself fits into a larger suite of spectral theorems that treat the diagonalizability of various families of linear transformations of inner product spaces (both finite and infinite dimensional).</div>
