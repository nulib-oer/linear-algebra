<p>Our definitions of the logical operators above are chosen to agree with their usage in a very particular type of discourse: namely, <em class="emphasis">mathematical</em> discourse. They do not always agree with their use in natural language: hence the modifier “logical” in their titles.</p>
<p>For example, disjunctions in natural language of the form “<span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span>” are often understood to be true when <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is true or <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span> is true, <em class="emphasis">but not both</em>. This notion of disjunction is called the <em class="emphasis">exclusive or</em> in logic, in contrast to the standard logical or.</p>
<p>Similarly, according to our definition, the implication “If the President of the US is a dog, then the Vice President of the US is a cat” is true, since the proposition “The President of the US is a dog” is false. (In logic we say the implication is <em class="emphasis">vacuously true</em> in this case.) However, working outside of our logical definitions of truth value, we may have been inclined to treat this implication as false, since both “The President of the US is a dog” and “The Vice President of the US is a cat” are false.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_logic.html#rm_logic_vs_vernacular">in-context</a></span>
