<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be an <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrix. Using Gauss-Jordan elimination, we can row reduce <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> in reduced row echelon form. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is also row equivalent to the matrix <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> in reduced row echelon form. Then <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are row equivalent, since the row equivalence relation is symmetric and transitive (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rm_row_equivalence_props.html" title="Remark 3.4.14: Properties of row equivalence">Remark 3.4.14</a>). Thus it suffices to show that if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are row equivalent matrices in reduced row echelon form, then <span class="process-math">\(U=U'\text{.}\)</span> We do so by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The base step is trivial, since there is only one <span class="process-math">\(m\times 1\)</span> matrix in reduced row echelon form.</p>
<p>For the induction step we assume that any two row equivalent <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrices in reduced row echelon form are equal.  Suppose by contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(U=[u_{ij}]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'=[u'_{ij}]\)</span> are row equivalent <span class="process-math">\(m\times (n+1)\)</span> matrices in reduced row echelon form, and that <span class="process-math">\(U\ne U'\text{.}\)</span>  By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_row_equivalence_invertibility.html" title="Corollary 3.4.13: Row equivalence and invertible matrices">Corollary 3.4.13</a> there is an invertible matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(QU=U'\text{.}\)</span> The first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> form matrices <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V'\text{,}\)</span> respectively, that are in reduced row echelon form, as one easily checks. Furthermore, <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V'\)</span> are row equivalent: indeed, using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_column_method.html" title="Theorem 3.1.19: Column method of matrix multiplication">Theorem 3.1.19</a> we see that <span class="process-math">\(QU=U'\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(QV=V'\text{.}\)</span> By the induction hypothesis we must have <span class="process-math">\(V=V'\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> can only differ in their last column.</p>
<p>We claim that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> must both have a leading one in the last column. To see why, consider the matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(U\boldx=\boldzero\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\boldx=[x_j]\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\((n+1)\times 1 \)</span> column vector. Since <span class="process-math">\(QU=U'\text{,}\)</span> we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
U\boldx=\boldzero \amp\implies QU\boldx=Q\boldzero  \\
\amp\implies U'\boldx=\boldzero \amp (U'=QU) \text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and thus</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
U\boldx=\boldzero\implies U\boldx-U'\boldx=\boldzero\implies (U-U')\boldx=\boldzero\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Because <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> differ in at most their last column, the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U-U'\)</span> are zero columns, and thus we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
(U-U')\boldx=[x_{n+1}(u_{i(n+1)}-u'_{i(n+1)})]=\boldzero\text{.}\tag{3.4.5}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(U\ne U'\text{,}\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(1\leq i\leq m\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(u_{i(n+1)}\ne u'_{i(n+1)}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x_{n+1}(u_{i(n+1)}-u'_{i(n+1)})=0\)</span> by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_unique_rref.html" title="Equation 3.4.5">(3.4.5)</a>, we must have <span class="process-math">\(x_{n+1}=0\text{.}\)</span> We have shown that for any <span class="process-math">\(\boldx=[x_j]\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(U\boldx=\boldzero\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(x_{n+1}=0\text{.}\)</span> It follows from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_solveSystem.html" title="Theorem 2.3.5: Solving linear systems">Theorem 2.3.5</a> that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> must have a leading in its last column, since otherwise the variable <span class="process-math">\(x_{n+1}\)</span> in the system <span class="process-math">\(U\boldx=0\)</span> would be free, and could assume any value. To see that <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> also has a leading one in the last column, we use the same argument, starting with the equation <span class="process-math">\(Q^{-1}U'=U\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To summarize, starting with row equivalent matrices  <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> in reduced row echelon form, and assuming by contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(U\ne U'\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that (a) the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are equal and form matrices in reduced row echelon form, and (b) the last columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> have leading ones. Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are in reduced row echelon form, and since the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> are equal, we see that the leading ones in the last columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> must occur in the same row: namely, the first zero row of <span class="process-math">\(V=V'\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(U=U'\text{,}\)</span> a contradiction.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_invertibility_theorem.html#proof-29">in-context</a></span>
