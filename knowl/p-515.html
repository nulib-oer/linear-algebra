<div class="para">At last we are ready to define Gaussian elimination. In its essence this is simply a procedure, or <em class="emphasis">algorithm</em>, that takes an input matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and row reduces it to a matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> in row echelon form. It is important to note that although we employ Gaussian elimination in this chapter primarily to the end of simplifying and solving linear systems, this is not its only application. Indeed, we will come back to the procedure again and again, in a great variety of contexts and to greatly diverse ends. Gaussian elimination is one of linear algebraâ€™s most important tools. We memorialize this here as an official principle.</div>
