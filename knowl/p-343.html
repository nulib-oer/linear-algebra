<div class="para">Statement (2) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_poly_basic.html" title="Theorem 0.7.3: Basic properties of polynomials">TheoremÂ 0.7.3</a> makes a connection between roots of a polynomial and factorization; and the expression <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_poly_factor.html" title="Equation 0.7.3">(0.7.3)</a> can be thought of as a first step in writing the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as a product of linear polynomials. The existence of roots depends on the given domain of the function. Indeed,  there are plenty of polynomials <span class="process-math">\(f\colon \R\rightarrow \R\)</span> that have no roots whatsoever: for example, from the quadratic formula we know that any quadratic polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(b^2-4ac\lt 0\)</span> has no real roots. According to the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_fund_alg.html" title="Theorem 0.7.7: Fundamental theorem of algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a>, the situation over <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> is vastly different: not only does every polymonial have a root in <span class="process-math">\(\C\text{,}\)</span> we can factor it completely as a product of linear polynomials. This is one of the main incentives for introducing the complex numbers as a number system.</div>
