<div class="para">We proceed geometrically by observing that each equation in a given system defines a line, that a pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is a solution to the given equation if and only if it is a point on the corresponding line, and thus that a pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is a solution to both equations if and only if it is a point lying on both lines. Thus, geometrically speaking, the set of solutions to a given system is equal to the intersection of the two corresponding lines.</div>

<li><div class="para">In this case the two lines <span class="process-math">\(\ell_1\colon x-y=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell_2\colon x-y=1\)</span> are parallel (and not equal to one another). It follows that their intersection is empty. We conclude that there are no solutions to the system.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In this case the two lines <span class="process-math">\(\ell_1\colon x-y=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell_2\colon x+y=1\)</span> are nonparallel. It follows that they intersect in a single point. We conclude that the system has a unique solution.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In this case the two equations <span class="process-math">\(x-y=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2x-2y=2\)</span> define the same line <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{,}\)</span> and thus that their intersection is also equal to <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{.}\)</span> The set of solutions to the system is then equal to the set of points of <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{,}\)</span> which is infinite.</div></li>
