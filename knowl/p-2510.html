<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(\Span S=V\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> be a subset of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <em class="emphasis">minimal cardinality</em> such that <span class="process-math">\(\Span S'\)</span> is still equal to <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Such a set is guaranteed to exist: since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is finite, it has a finite number of subsets; of these subsets some will span, others will not; of the subsets that do span, there will be one (or more) that has the least number of elements.</div>
<div class="para">We claim that such a spanning subset <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> of minimal cardinality is linearly independent, and hence is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> as desired. We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> is linearly dependent. Then some element of <span class="process-math">\(S'\text{,}\)</span> call it <span class="process-math">\(\boldv_0\text{,}\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of the other elements (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rm_linear_independence.html" title="Remark 3.5.10">Remark 3.5.10</a>). Then in terms of span, the element <span class="process-math">\(\boldv_0\)</span> is “redundant”. In other words, if we let <span class="process-math">\(S''=S'-\{\boldv_0\}\text{,}\)</span> the set obtained by “throwing out” <span class="process-math">\(\boldv_0\text{,}\)</span> then we have <span class="process-math">\(\Span S''=\Span S'=V\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\val{S''} &lt; \val{S}\text{,}\)</span> this contradicts our choice of <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> as a spanning set of minimal cardinality. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> is linearly independent, completing the proof.</div>

<li><div class="para">Each <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> is linearly independent.

<li><div class="para">The procedure must halt. Why?

<div class="para">From (ii) we may assume the procedure halts at <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\geq 0\text{.}\)</span> From (i) we know that <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> is linearly independent.
