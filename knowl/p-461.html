<div class="para">Now suppose <span class="process-math">\(P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q=(x_2,y_2,z_2)\)</span> are two distinct solutions to the system. Let <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> be the unique line containing <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> (Fact 1). I claim that <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> is precisely the set of solutions to the system. To see this, take any two equations in the system <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}_j\colon a_jx+b_jy+c_iz=d_j\text{.}\)</span> Since the two corresponding planes are distinct, and intersect in at least the points <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> they must intersect in a line (Fact 2); since this line contains <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> it must be the line <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> (Fact 1). Thus any two planes in the system intersect in the line <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{.}\)</span> From this it follows that: (a) a point satisfying the system must lie in <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{;}\)</span> and (b) all points on <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> satisfy the system (since we have shown that <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> lies in all the planes). It follows that <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> is precisely the set of solutions, and hence that there are infinitely many solutions.</div>
