<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>By (2) we know that <span class="process-math">\(\NS A=\NS U, \RS A=\RS U\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dim\CS A=\dim\CS U\text{.}\)</span> So it is enough to show that <span class="process-math">\(\dim \NS U=\dim\RS U=r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dim \NS U=s\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>First, we will show that the <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> nonzero rows of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\RS U\text{,}\)</span> proving <span class="process-math">\(\dim\RS U=r\text{.}\)</span> Clearly the nonzero rows span <span class="process-math">\(\RS U\text{,}\)</span> since any linear combination of all the rows of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of the nonzero rows. Furthermore, since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is in row echelon form, the staircase pattern of the leading ones appearing in the nonzero rows assures that these row vectors are linearly independent.</p>
<p>Next, we show that the columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> containing leading ones form a basis of <span class="process-math">\(\CS U\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\boldu_{i_1},\dots, \boldu_{i_r}\)</span> be the columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> with leading ones, and let <span class="process-math">\(\boldu_{j_1}, \boldu_{j_2}, \dots, \boldu_{j_s}\)</span> be the columns without leading ones. To prove the <span class="process-math">\(\boldu_{i_k}\)</span> form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\CS U\text{,}\)</span> we will show that given any <span class="process-math">\(\boldy\in \CS U\)</span> there is a <em class="emphasis">unique</em> choice of scalars <span class="process-math">\(c_1, c_2,\dots,
c_r\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(c_1\boldu_{i_1}+\cdots +c_r\boldu_{i_r}=\boldy\text{.}\)</span> (Recall that the uniqueness of this choice implies linear independence.)</p>
<p>So assume <span class="process-math">\(\boldy\in \CS U\text{.}\)</span> Then we can find <span class="process-math">\(\boldx\in\R^n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(U\boldx=\boldy\text{,}\)</span> which means the linear system with augmented matrix <span class="process-math">\([\ U\ \vert \ \boldy]\)</span> is consistent. Using our Gaussian elimination theory (specifically, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_solveSystem.html" title="Theorem 2.3.5: Solving linear systems">Theorem 2.3.5</a>), we know that the solutions <span class="process-math">\(\boldx=(x_1,x_2,\dots,
x_n)\)</span> to this system are in 1-1 correspondence with choices for the free variables <span class="process-math">\(x_{j_1}=t_{j_1}, x_{j_2}=t_{j_2}, \dots,
x_{j_s}=t_{j_s}\text{.}\)</span> (Remember that the columns <span class="process-math">\(\boldu_{j_k}\)</span> without leading ones correspond to the free variables.) In particular, there is a unique solution to <span class="process-math">\(U\boldx=\boldy\)</span> where we set all the free variables equal to 0. By the column method (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_column_method.html" title="Theorem 3.1.19: Column method of matrix multiplication">Theorem 3.1.19</a>), this gives us a unique linear combination of only the columns <span class="process-math">\(\boldu_{i_k}\)</span> with leading ones equal to <span class="process-math">\(\boldy\text{.}\)</span> This proves the claim, and shows that the columns with leading ones form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\CS U\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\dim\CS U=r\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Lastly,  again using the results of (1), we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\dim NS U \amp =\dim NS T_U \\
\amp =n-\dim\im T_U \amp (\knowl{./knowl/th_rank-nullity.html}{\text{Theorem 4.6.2}}) \\
\amp =n-\dim\CS U\\
\amp =n-r \\
\amp =s \text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where the last equality uses the fact that the sum of the number of columns with leading ones (<span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>) and the number of columns without leading ones (<span class="process-math">\(s\)</span>) is <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> the total number of columns.</p></article></body>
