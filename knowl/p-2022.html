As remarked in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_injective_surjective_bijective.html" title="Definition 0.2.7: Injective, surjective, bijective">Definition 0.2.7</a>, there is in general a direct connection between the surjectivity and the image of a function: namely, <span class="process-math">\(f\colon X\rightarrow Y\)</span> is surjective if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\im f=Y\text{.}\)</span> It follows immediately that a linear transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\colon V\rightarrow W\)</span> is surjective if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\im T=W\text{.}\)</span> As for injectivity, it is relatively easy to see that <em class="emphasis">if</em> a linear transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is injective, <em class="emphasis">then</em> its null space must consist of just the zero vector of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> What is somewhat surprising is that the converse is also true, as described in (2) of the theorem below.</div>
