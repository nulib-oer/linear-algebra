<p>Similarly, according to our definition, the implication “If the President of the US is a dog, then the Vice President of the US is a cat” is true, since the proposition “The President of the US is a dog” is false. (In logic we say the implication is <em class="emphasis">vacuously true</em> in this case.) However, working outside of our logical definitions of truth value, we may have been inclined to treat this implication as false, since both “The President of the US is a dog” and “The Vice President of the US is a cat” are false.</p>
